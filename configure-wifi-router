To configure a wifi router, you will need to connect to it using a web browser. Follow these general steps:

Connect your computer or mobile device to the router's network.
Open a web browser and enter the router's IP address in the address bar. (You can find the IP address on the router itself or in the documentation that came with it)
Enter the router's login credentials (username and password) when prompted. If you haven't set them before, the default credentials are usually found in the documentation or on the router itself.
Once you are logged in, you will be on the router's main configuration page. You can now change the settings as you like.
Look for the wifi setting and change the name of your network and the password.
Save the changes and reboot the router.
